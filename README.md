HASTMON is a monitoring daemon that allows a couple of hosts to
run a service providing automatic failover. Those machines will
be called a cluster and each machine is one cluster node. HASTMON
is designed for clusters that work in Primary-Secondary
configuration, which means that only one of the cluster nodes can
be active at any given time. See README for details.
