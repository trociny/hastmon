HASTMON is a monitoring daemon that allows a couple of hosts to run a service providing automatic failover. Those machines will be called a cluster and each machine is one cluster node. HASTMON is designed for clusters that work in Primary-Secondary configuration, which means that only one of the cluster nodes can be active at any given time. See [README](http://code.google.com/p/hastmon/wiki/README) for details.
